		<p class="mb-4">
			I'm a Hungarian software engineer with 10+ years of experience, currently located
			in London. I specialize in designing and building scalable, high-performance web applications,
			with a strong focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and efficient backend systems. I
			was working for companies like the Daily Mail, Capgemini, Betsson Group, Racing Post and Origo
			(one of the largest newsportals in Hungary). I hold a Master's Degree in Mathematics and
			Computer Sciences.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies and frameworks,
			contributing to projects in various industries including fintech, online gaming, e-commerce
			and SaaS.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Over the years, my tech stack has evolved significantly. I started my career working mostly
			with PHP, building dynamic websites and custom CMS solutions. As the web ecosystem matured, I
			transitioned into JavaScript and later TypeScript, working on full stack applications using
			modern frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express. More recently, I've been focused on Go
			(Golang), leveraging its performance and concurrency strengths to develop scalable
			microservices and backend APIs.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I have a strong interest in cloud technologies and DevOps practices, with hands-on experience using AWS, Azure, GCP,
			Docker, and Kubernetes to deploy and manage production applications. I believe
			in the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, and I'm always looking for ways to
			improve development processes through automation and proven best practices.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges and continuously improving
			development workflows and system reliability.
