			in London. I specialize in designing and building scalable, high-performance web applications,
			with a strong focus on clean architecture, maintainable code, and efficient backend systems. I
			was working for companies like the Daily Mail, Capgemini, Betsson Group, Racing Post and Origo
			(one of the largest newsportals in Hungary). I hold a Master's Degree in Mathematics and
			Computer Sciences.</p> <p class="mb-4">Throughout my career, I've worked with a wide range of technologies and frameworks,
			contributing to projects in various industries including fintech, online gaming, e-commerce
			and SaaS.</p> <p class="mb-4">Over the years, my tech stack has evolved significantly. I started my career working mostly
			with PHP, building dynamic websites and custom CMS solutions. As the web ecosystem matured, I
			transitioned into JavaScript and later TypeScript, working on full stack applications using
			modern frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express. More recently, I've been focused on Go
			(Golang), leveraging its performance and concurrency strengths to develop scalable
			microservices and backend APIs.</p> <p class="mb-4">I have a strong interest in cloud technologies and DevOps practices, having worked with AWS,
			Docker, and Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications in production environments. I believe
			in the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, and I'm always looking for ways to
			improve development processes through automation and best practices.</p> <p class="mb-4">I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges and continuously improving
			development workflows and system reliability.</p></div></section>`);function H(l){var t=B();u(l,t)}var G=h('<li class="mr-1.5 mt-2"><div class="flex items-center rounded-full bg-teal-400/10 px-3 py-1 text-xs font-medium leading-5 text-teal-300 "> </div></li>');function T(l,t){var i=G(),n=a(i),r=a(n,!0);e(n),e(i),A(()=>v(r,t.label)),u(l,i)}var J=j('<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor" class="ml-1 inline-block h-4 w-4 shrink-0 translate-y-px transition-transform group-hover/link:translate-x-1 group-hover/link:-translate-y-1 group-focus-visible/link:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible/link:-translate-y-1 motion-reduce:transition-none" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5.22 14.78a.75.75 0 001.06 0l7.22-7.22v5.69a.75.75 0 001.5 0v-7.5a.75.75 0 00-.75-.75h-7.5a.75.75 0 000 1.5h5.69l-7.22 7.22a.75.75 0 000 1.06z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg>');function I(l){var t=J();u(l,t)}var N=h('<div class="group relative grid pb-1 transition-all sm:grid-cols-8 sm:gap-8 md:gap-4 lg:group-hover/list:opacity-50 lg:hover:!opacity-100"><div class="absolute -inset-x-4 -inset-y-4 z-0 hidden rounded-md transition motion-reduce:transition-none lg:-inset-x-6 lg:block lg:group-hover:bg-slate-800/50 lg:group-hover:shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_0_rgba(148,163,184,0.1)] lg:group-hover:drop-shadow-lg"></div> <header class="z-10 mt-1 mb-2 text-xs font-semibold tracking-wide text-slate-500 uppercase sm:col-span-2"> </header> <div class="z-10 sm:col-span-6"><h3 class="leading-snug font-medium text-slate-200"><div><a class="group/link inline-flex items-baseline text-base leading-tight font-medium text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="absolute -inset-x-4 -inset-y-2.5 hidden rounded md:-inset-x-6 md:-inset-y-4 lg:block"></span> <span> <span class="inline-block"> <!></span></span></a></div></h3> <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-normal whitespace-pre-line"> </p> <ul class="mt-2 flex flex-wrap" aria-label="Technologies used"></ul></div></div>');function L(l,t){var i=N(),n=o(a(i),2),r=a(n,!0);e(n);var p=o(n,2),s=a(p),c=a(s),d=a(c),y=o(a(d),2),b=a(y),g=o(b),w=a(g),x=o(w);I(x),e(g),e(y),e(d),e(c),e(s);var k=o(s,2),S=a(k,!0);e(k);var D=o(k,2);P(D,21,()=>t.skills,R,(_,C)=>{T(_,{get label(){return m(C)}})}),e(D),e(p),e(i),A(()=>{f(n,"aria-label",t.time),v(r,t.time),f(d,"href",t.link),f(d,"aria-label",`${t.title??""} (opens in a new tab)`),v(b,`${t.title??""} · `),v(w,`${t.company??""} `),v(S,t.description)}),u(l,i)}var z=h('<li class="mb-12"><!></li>'),O=h('<section id="experience" class="mb-16 scroll-mt-16 md:mb-24 lg:mb-36 lg:scroll-mt-24"><div class="sticky top-0 z-20 -mx-6 mb-4 w-screen bg-slate-900/75 px-6 py-5 backdrop-blur md:-mx-12 md:px-12 lg:relative lg:top-auto lg:mx-auto lg:w-full lg:px-0 lg:py-0"><h2 class="text-sm font-bold tracking-widest text-slate-200 uppercase">Experience</h2></div> <div><ol class="group/list"></ol> <div class="mt-12"><a class="group/link inline-flex items-baseline text-base leading-tight font-medium font-semibold text-slate-200 text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300" href="Gabor_Koos_resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="View Full Résumé (opens in a new tab)"><span>Download <span class="inline-block">Résumé<!></span></span></a></div></div></section>');function Q(l){const t=[{time:"2024 - 2025",company:"dmg media (Daily Mail)",link:"https://www.dailymail.co.uk",title:"Senior Software Engineer",description:`
